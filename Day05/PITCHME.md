# Do Now

Create a new circuit with a 9V battery and an LED in series with a 470 ohm resistor. Create a second branch with a 1k ohm resistor connecting from power to ground. What happens to the LED when you add that resistor? What happens when you change the value of that resistor?

# Objectives

* Variable resistors (potentiometers and LDRs)
* Voltage dividers
* Blink
---
# Variable Resistors

* Change resistance in some way (turning a knob, changing light, etc.)
* Use a voltage divider to produce a change in voltage
