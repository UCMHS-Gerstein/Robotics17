# Do Now

Create a new circuit in Tinkercad to light up 3 LEDs using a 9V battery. This circuit should be in a breadboard.
---
# Objectives

* Review breadboards, LEDs and buttons
* Series and parallel circuits
* Variable resistors (potentiometers and LDRs)
---
# Series and Parallel Circuits

* Series circuits have only one possible route for current to follow
* Parallel circuits have multiple routes
* Can have circuits with elements have both
---
# Series Circuits

* Total resistance is sum of all resistances
* Voltage drop is proportional to a given resistor's share of total resistance
---
# Parallel Circuits

* Total resistance is 1/(1/r1 + 1/r2 + 1/r3...)
* Total resistance decreases as number of branches increases
---
# Variable Resistors

* Change resistance in some way (turning a knob, changing light, etc.)
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Use a voltage divider to produce a change in voltage
